# Investigative Report: Operation Crystal Clear

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Operation CrystalHarry BentonClear uncovered a sophisticated criminal network operating through a web of smuggling, drug trafficking and money‑laundering activities in the Netherlands during July 2022. The core enterprise is orchestrated by **Nerijus Bos**, with logistical support from **Rosie Boudica** and **Liss (Lizzard)**, transport execution by **Joseph Prinse**, procurement coordination via **Quan Xiuan**, and financial facilitation by **Antonio Gotta** and his partner **nb/​NB**.  

Key findings:

* **Illicit cargo movement:** Smuggling of unspecified goods, drug deliveries to Ibiza, and a Patek watch shipment were coordinated through freight routes and concealed in regular transport packages.
* **Cash handling:** Large sums were transferred via Dutch bank accounts (e.g., NL40 ABNA 665599774) and Bitcoin, indicating money‑laundering operations tied to the cargo.
* **Intimidation tactics:** The group threatened law‑enforcement contact at multiple points (port incidents, police stops), demonstrating a deliberate strategy to avoid detection.
* **Contradiction of suspect statements:** Both **Quan Xiuan** and **Joseph Prinse** denied knowledge or responsibility for the cash; evidence shows their direct involvement in logistics and money transfer.

The network is now fully mapped, enabling targeted action against all identified actors.

## 2. Introduction and Background
On **JulyHarry Benton21,Harry Benton2022**, two suspects—*Quan Xiuan* and *Joseph Prinse*—were arrested holding a large amount of cash. Their digital devices were seized and reviewed.  

- **Quan Xiuan** claimed the money was a family inheritance for studies and gambling debts.  
- **Joseph Prinse** stated he had no knowledge of the cash, asserting he merely provided a standard client pickup for his car‑rental business.

The incident summary notes the suspects’ possession of unexplained funds and the subsequent digital forensic investigation that revealed coordinated smuggling operations.

## 3. Analysis of Evidence: Refuting Initial Statements

### 3.1 Quan Xiuan
**Initial Claim:** The cash is a family inheritance for educational purposes and gambling debts.  

**Contradictory Evidence:**  
- **G-1 (2fbd9c9e‑e242‑46cb‑910f‑64c7c314b310:0‑0‑0‑1‑0‑0‑2‑9‑1‑7‑1a)** – Figo Johnson instructs Quan to purchase a suitcase via Marktplaats, pay cash in person, and send photos of the suitcase, drugs, and lab. This shows Quan’s active role in the procurement of illicit items.  
- **L-1 (a0518702‑3584‑4b83‑a97e‑de437493e4de:0‑0‑0‑1‑0‑0‑0‑1‑1‑1‑0‑19‑a‑1)** – Quan is directed to transfer a suitcase and send images, again indicating direct involvement in illicit transport.  
- **D-3 (9f4a2008‑2d40‑44e8‑90f8‑beee7dbf1822:0‑0‑0‑1‑0‑0‑0‑2‑1‑1‑0‑5‑a‑3)** – Quan is explicitly instructed to be picked up at the airport by Joseph on 21 July, showing a pre‑planned role in the operation.  

These records demonstrate that Quan was actively engaged in the smuggling logistics and money handling, directly contradicting his claim of passive inheritance.

### 3.2 Joseph Prinse
**Initial Claim:** He had no knowledge of the cash; he merely performed a standard client pickup for his car‑rental business.  

**Contradictory Evidence:**  
- **A-7 (bca33c09‑0be5‑4729‑9c2a‑1634e5e20915:0‑0‑0‑1‑0‑0‑0‑2‑1‑1‑0‑24‑a‑7)** – Joseph confirms he will pick up Quan at the airport on 21 July.  
- **C-7 (bca33c09‑0be5‑4729‑9c2a‑1634e5e20915:0‑0‑0‑1‑0‑0‑0‑2‑1‑1‑0‑24‑a‑3)** – Similar pickup instructions.  
- **D-1 (9f4a2008‑2d40‑44e8‑90f8‑beee7dbf1822:0‑0‑0‑1‑0‑0‑0‑2‑1‑1‑0‑5‑a‑1)** – Joseph participates in a quick delivery of a package to the store depot.  
- **I-0 (9194b1ef‑8411‑4295‑a793‑0d4475f95d2d:0‑0‑0‑1‑0‑0‑6‑0‑3‑0‑6‑0‑1)** – Joseph delivers a package to the depot and faces police scrutiny.  

These logs confirm that Joseph was a key driver in transporting both goods and cash, directly refuting his assertion of ignorance.

## 6. Analysis of Modus Operandi

### Hierarchy & Decision‑Making
At the apex sits **Nerijus Bos**, who orchestrates all movements, finances, and communications. He assigns tasks to subordinates—Rosie Boudica handles logistics and payment facilitation; Liss (Lizzard) operates at depot sites; Joseph Prinse is the driver/transport operator; Quan Xiuan manages procurement and secure communication; Antonio Gotta supplies high‑value goods and finances; nb/​NB executes wire transfers.

### Logistics & Transport
The group uses **freight routes** and hides contraband in standard transport packages to evade detection (A‑3, H‑?). Periodic security checks are avoided by adjusting schedules to Fridays when staff is minimal. Vehicles used include Joseph’s car and an aircraft for international flights (airport pickup on July 21). Depot operations at IJmuiden and store depots facilitate last‑mile delivery.

### Financial Operations
Funds flow through Dutch bank account **NL40 ABNA 665599774** (Rosie Fashion) and via **Bitcoin** for drug deliveries. Antonio’s invoices for the Patek watch and drug shipments are paid by wire transfers, confirming money laundering channels. The large cash sum found on suspects likely originated from these transactions.

### Security & Intimidation
Repeated threats to Liss and other operatives not to contact police (B‑29, C‑33) indicate an intent to silence witnesses and deter law‑enforcement involvement. Police stops at depots are treated as intimidation tactics rather than investigations.

## 7. Conclusions and Recommendations

1. **Arrest & Detention of Key Operatives**  
   - Immediate arrest of *Nerijus Bos*, *Rosie Boudica*, *Liss (Lizzard)*, *Joseph Prinse*, *Quan Xiuan*, *Antonio Gotta*, and *nb/​NB* is warranted based on the evidence.  
2. **Asset Seizure**  
   - Confiscate the large cash sum, bank accounts NL40 ABNA 665599774, Bitcoin wallets, and any related financial instruments.  
3. **Evidence Preservation**  
   - Preserve all trace IDs and associated metadata for chain‑of‑custody records; ensure secure storage of chat logs and digital devices.  
4. **Further Investigation**  
   - Conduct a forensic audit of the bank account NL40 ABNA 665599774 to identify additional beneficiaries or shell accounts.  
   - Trace Bitcoin transactions linked to B‑1a and related invoices for potential cross‑border links.  
5. **Witness Protection & Intelligence Sharing**  
   - Offer protection to cooperating witnesses (e.g., individuals who reported police stops) and coordinate with international partners due to the cross‑border nature of the operations (Ibiza, UK shipments).  

The compiled evidence demonstrates a coordinated smuggling and money‑laundering ring operating under the cover of legitimate logistics. Prompt law‑enforcement action as outlined will disrupt their network and recover assets.
