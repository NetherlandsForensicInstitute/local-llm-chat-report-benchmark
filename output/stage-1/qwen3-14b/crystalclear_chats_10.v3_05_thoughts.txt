Okay, let me start by looking at the user's query. They provided a large set of raw chat logs and want me to extract relevant information based on specific criteria.

First, I need to recall the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria cover logistics & transport, financial transactions, coded language, coordination/instructions, and threats/security. Exclusion includes spam, system messages, and mundane chats.

Looking through the provided evidence, most of the messages are promotional content for various crypto projects, airdrops, IDylan Ballards, etc. These would fall under spam or advertisements, which are excluded. However, I need to check if any messages discuss logistics, financial transactions between participants, coded language, coordination, or security threats.

The only non-promotional messages are the ones between Nerijus Bos and Camilo Hurst Jaelynn Everett. They're casual greetings and questions about location. These don't relate to any of the inclusion criteria. There's no mention of shipments, financial transactions, coded terms, coordination tasks, or security issues. 

Therefore, none of the messages meet the inclusion criteria. All are either promotional (excluded) or mundane social chatter (also excluded). The user's example shows a structure for records, but since there's nothing to extract, I should output nothing as per instructions.
