### **Investigative Report: Operation Crystal Clear**

**1. Executive Summary**

Digital forensic analysis of confiscated devices has uncovered a sophisticated criminal enterprise involved in drug trafficking and money laundering. The operation, led by Nerijus Bos, utilized a network of individuals with distinct roles to facilitate the smuggling of illicit goods through the port of IJmuiden. Key figures include Antonio Gotta, who appears to be a major partner or supplier; Rosie Boudica, who facilitated logistics at the port; Joseph Prinse, who provided transportation and logistics support; and Quan Xiuan, who acted as a courier. The operation employed encrypted communication and sought to launder proceeds through various channels, including a front company, "Rosie Fashion," and cryptocurrency transactions. The initial statements provided by suspects Quan Xiuan and Joseph Prinse upon their arrest are demonstrably false based on the digital evidence.

**2. Introduction and Background**

On July 21, 2022, Detective John Miller of the Amsterdam Police arrested two suspects, Quan Xiuan and Joseph Prinse, who were found with a significant, unexplained amount of cash. Their digital devices were seized and subsequently analyzed using the Hansken digital forensic platform. This analysis of chat logs and other digital traces forms the basis of this report. The initial statements from the suspects were contradictory. Quan Xiuan claimed the money was a family inheritance intended for his studies and to settle gambling debts, offering a classmate, Julia Sheila, as a potential alibi. Joseph Prinse asserted that he was merely a driver for his car rental business, "Prinse Rental," and was picking up a client, denying any knowledge of the cash. The digital evidence detailed below comprehensively refutes these claims.

**3. Analysis of Evidence: Refuting Initial Statements**

**Quan Xiuan:**

Quan Xiuan's assertion that the large sum of cash was a family inheritance is directly contradicted by digital evidence. A WhatsApp conversation between Nerijus Bos and Quan Xiuan on July 7, 2022, clearly indicates a pre-arranged meeting for July 21, 2022, where Joseph Prinse was instructed to pick him up. Further incriminating evidence comes from a WhatsApp conversation between Figo Johnson and Quan Xiuan on July 11, 2022. In this exchange, Johnson provides Xiuan with explicit instructions for a "family visit," which include purchasing a suitcase for a "transfer," sending photos of the suitcase, and, most damningly, sending photos of "the drugs and the lab" via Snapchat. This conversation unequivocally links Quan Xiuan to a planned drug-related activity, dismantling his inheritance and gambling debt narrative. His attempt to use Julia Sheila as an alibi is also questionable, as their conversations appear casual and do not substantiate his claims.

**Joseph Prinse:**

Joseph Prinse's statement that he was simply a car rental driver with no knowledge of the cash is thoroughly discredited by multiple chat logs. A WhatsApp conversation between Nerijus Bos and Joseph Prinse on July 11, 2022, shows Bos directing Prinse to pick up Quan Xiuan at the airport on July 21 and to visit a specific address: Bronsstraat 8, 1976 BC, IJmuiden. This indicates a coordinated effort beyond a simple car rental transaction. More significantly, a WhatsApp conversation between Rosie Boudica and Nerijus Bos on July 15, 2022, reveals that "Liss has been spotted with one of Joseph's cars at the depot," causing "nasty questions." This places Prinse's vehicle at a location central to the smuggling operation. Furthermore, a WhatsApp exchange between Joseph Prinse and Nerijus Bos on July 20, 2022, discusses the liability of "Lizz knows too much," with Bos stating he will send her a "clear message." This conversation demonstrates Prinse's deep involvement and knowledge of the illicit nature of their activities, directly contradicting his claim of being an unwitting car rental owner.

**6. Analysis of Modus Operandi**

**Hierarchy and Communication:**

The criminal organization appears to have a clear hierarchical structure with Nerijus Bos at the top, directing operations. Bos communicates directly with his subordinates, giving instructions and receiving updates. The group utilizes encrypted messaging applications like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal for their communications, indicating a conscious effort to evade surveillance. The request for Rosie Boudica to install GrapheneOS, a security-hardened mobile operating system, further highlights their operational security awareness.

**Logistics and Smuggling:**

The enterprise's primary logistical activity involves smuggling goods, explicitly referred to as "drugs," through the port. Rosie Boudica plays a crucial role by providing inside information on port operations, including the best times to move goods to avoid detection and how to manipulate schedules. The use of "freight routes" and hiding goods in regular transport packages suggests a sophisticated method of concealment. Joseph Prinse's car rental business provides a convenient cover for transportation, and individuals like Quan Xiuan are employed as couriers.

**Financial Operations:**

The organization employs multiple methods for its financial transactions. Rosie Boudica's "Rosie Fashion" business is used as a front for money laundering, with bank transfers being made to its account. There is also clear evidence of the use of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, for payments related to drug deliveries, as discussed between Antonio Gotta and Nerijus Bos. This indicates an effort to obscure the flow of illicit funds.

**Security:**

The group demonstrates a concern for security. They use encrypted communication platforms and discuss the need for more secure operating systems like GrapheneOS. When a potential leak is identified, in the form of Liss, Nerijus Bos takes immediate action to intimidate her into silence, demonstrating a ruthless approach to protecting the organization. The use of Snapchat for sensitive image transfers by Figo Johnson, likely due to its ephemeral nature, is another tactic to minimize digital evidence.

**7. Conclusions and Recommendations**

The digital evidence unequivocally establishes the existence of a well-organized criminal network engaged in drug trafficking and money laundering. The initial statements by Quan Xiuan and Joseph Prinse are blatant falsehoods intended to mislead investigators.

Based on the findings of this report, the following actions are recommended:

*   **Issue arrest warrants** for Nerijus Bos, Antonio Gotta, Rosie Boudica, and Figo Johnson on charges of drug trafficking, conspiracy, and money laundering.
*   **Conduct further interviews** with Quan Xiuan and Joseph Prinse, presenting them with the digital evidence to obtain confessions and further intelligence on the organization's operations.
*   **Interview Liss** as a potential key witness. Her testimony could provide crucial insights into the activities of Joseph Prinse and the broader organization.
*   **Initiate international cooperation** with law enforcement agencies in the UK and Spain (specifically Ibiza) to investigate the full scope of Antonio Gotta's involvement and the organization's international drug distribution network.
*   **Conduct a thorough financial investigation** into "Rosie Fashion" and any associated bank accounts, as well as trace the cryptocurrency transactions mentioned in the chat logs to identify further assets and co-conspirators.
*   **Examine the address Bronsstraat 8, 1976 BC, IJmuiden,** as a likely operational hub or stash house for the organization.
