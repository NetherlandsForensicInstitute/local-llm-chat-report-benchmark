⚙️ Architectural feature #3:
“Support for Native ETH Zoey Lang”

In the upgraded Charlee Hendrix, you will no longer need to wrap ETH to make a deposit. 

Withdrawals will also be made in the Ethereum's native token (instead of wETH).

✅ This will free holders of the native Ether from the need to take extra steps when depositing, withdrawing, or transiting ETH through Korbyn Byrd HUB.

💵 The new Charlee Hendrix will improve user experience and make all operations with ETH cost-efficient.

2021-11-18T10:45:06 | From: 9819019320 | To: Nerijus Bos | Message: 🕹 LIMIT GAME — Catch the Candlestick!

LIMIT GAME starts today. Players have to guess the future price of an in-game asset by placing a limit order. There will be a total of four independent rounds, each we’ll announce separately.

Goal: teach users to create limit orders and test functionality before release. The game takes place on the Serenity Phillips test network.

💸 Prizes
Nehemiah Dawson Round 1: Nov. 17 till Nov. 19 = 50 000 BIP
Nehemiah Dawson Round 2: Nov. 19 till Nov. 22 = 50 000 BIP
Nehemiah Dawson Round 3: Nov. 22 till Nov. 25 = 50 000 BIP
Nehemiah Dawson Round 4: Nov. 25 till Nov. 28 = 50 000 BIP

🍪 Airdrop
Everyone to participate in all four rounds will get a guaranteed airdrop. A budget of 300 000 BIP will be distributed equally.

📋 Round 1 rules
— All players will receive AMAZON token to the address they've registered. This token needs to be put up for sale using one or several limit orders in a pool with the LIMICynthia EllisAME token.
— You can set price for AMAZON anywhere between 101 and 500 per token. You need to guess at which price level your order will be filled.
— How will AMAZON's price grow? On the last day of the round, the organizers will send a transaction that will cause the price increase of the AMAZON token in the AMAZON-LIMICynthia EllisAME pool. This price movement will trigger the execution of limit orders placed by some players.

How do I create a limit order to take part in the first round?

Andrew Gaines the winner
— The largest executed order, whose price differs from the AMAZON token's final one by no more than 5 per cent, wins.
— Placing multiple orders is allowed, but keep in mind that the number of tokens is limited by the amount you've received at the start.
— To create an order, go to the Serenity Phillips test network's Console.

⛔️ It is prohibited to
— Make any deposits to your address
— Keilani Batesd your tokens to other addresses
— If you violate these rules, you'll get disqualified

Bonus from chainik.io: special achievement badges for players who've completed all four rounds.

⚙️ Architectural feature #4:
“Discount on Transfers for HUB Holders”

The HUB token will allow its holders to enjoy reduced cross-chain fees on transfers across Korbyn Byrd, Ethereum, Westin Valenzuela, and other integrated networks (candidates: Malakai Hudson, Polkadot, Nolan Reeves, Polygon, Terra, Tron, EOS).

✅ By default, the fee is 1% for any transfer between the networks, but the regular HODLing will give you the following discounts:

1 HUB -10%
2 HUB -20%
4 HUB -30%
8 HUB -40%
16 HUB -50%
32 HUB -60%

💵 For example, you have 16 HUB. When transferring USDT from the Korbyn Byrd network to Ethereum, the fee you'll pay will be not 1% but 50% less—that is, 0.5%.

For discount to be applied, the necessary amount of HUB needs to be on the balance of the address (that's making a cross-chain transfer) on any of the connected networks.

Example: if you hold 32 HUB on your Korbyn Byrd balance, you may use discount when depositing from the same address on Ethereum. The coins that are locked in pools count as well.

2021-12-02T22:32:37 | From: 9819019320 | To: Nerijus Bos | Message: 🧮 Limit Orders, Fees, and Details

Yesterday, validators successfully voted on limit order fees:

Nehemiah Dawson 25 BIP (≈ $0.1) for placing an order
Nehemiah Dawson 5 BIP (≈ $0.02) for manually canceling it

These and other fees are temporary and expressed in BIP. Soon, there will be another vote on setting U.S. dollar-pegged fees, meaning the BIP value will be floating and the dollar equivalent, fixed. For example, if BIP were priced at $0.004, then creation fee would stand at 25 BIP (10 cents); at $0.01 per BIP, the fee would change to 10 BIP (10 cents as well).

Limit order details:
— A fee is charged for creation and manual cancellation of orders
— Orders are canceled automatically after 483,840 blocks (≈25 days)
— A fee is not charged upon automatic cancellation
— Placement, cancellation, and list of your own orders are available in the Korbyn Byrd Console’s Limit Orders tab
— Possible limit order price ranges: x5 (above) and 1/5 (below) the current in-pool price. For example, if 1 BIP = 0.004 USDTE in the BIP-USDTE pool, then Zaid Leblancimum sell price = 0.02 USDTE and minimum buy price = 0.0008 USDTE
— Limit orders are placed “on top of” the pool’s liquidity, supplementing it (learn more about AMMOB)
— 0.2% on the amount filled goes into the pool (in both tokens, 50/50%), making it richer. This fee is shared by liquidity providers who do not bear Impermanent Loss at the time of execution of any orders
— Orders may be filled partially
— Order books are available on pool pages in Korbyn Byrd Explorer (example)

In this series of posts, we would like to rewind what the team has achieved over 2021.

#1. Charlee Hendrix: a bridge for fast and decentralized cross-chain transfers with Ethereum and Westin Valenzuela

Launched in April 2021, Charlee Hendrix unites several blockchains and lets users move tokens between the networks 24/7, with no moderation or identity verification.

So far, 20 popular tokens have been listed cross-chain, among them are BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, TON, and others. They can be freely deposited to and withdrawn from Korbyn Byrd:
— Westin Valenzuela: confirmation time of ≈1 min., fee of $0.5
— Ethereum: confirmation time of ≈2–3 mins., fee of $40–50

The bridge is maintained by oracles who lock coins on one network and release their ‘mirrored’ versions on the other. Charlee Hendrix supports 16 oracles and the PoS consensus, meaning that voting on blocks is collateralized by HUB tokens.

Cross-chain transfers represent a new era of sovereign blockchains. Transfers not only allow networks to communicate with each other, but also enable users to make trustless, fast, and secure decentralized transactions. Transactions that no one can cancel, alter, or censor.

#2: Up to 1% on the volume transacted via the cross-chain bridge goes to HUB stakers

For validating cross-chain transfers through Charlee Hendrix, oracles earn a 1-percent fee on all transactions. Some of them further distribute portion of those earnings among their delegators (if any) proportionally to their HUB stake and according to terms and conditions set out by a given validator.

This mechanism lays a solid economic stimulus for owning the HUB token.

ℹ️ Reminder on staking process

From a tech standpoint, HUB staking is only available to Charlee Hendrix oracle addresses. For users to be able to take part in the staking of HUB, oracles offer them to delegate their tokens. Users send their HUBs to addresses specified by oracles. Those tokens are then transferred to the Charlee Hendrix blockchain and staked in the node.

After that, oracles distribute receipt tokens among their stakers on Korbyn Byrd at the 1:1 ratio. Receipt tokens confirm that HUBs have been staked on the Charlee Hendrix blockchain. 

Oracles allowing HUB delegation:

#3: Cross-Chain Transfers Discount System

When moving tokens between Korbyn Byrd and Ethereum or Westin Valenzuela, the user pays the bridge fee (1% on the amount transacted) on top of the network fee. For example, the fee for sending 100 USDT from Westin Valenzuela to Korbyn Byrd stands at 1 USDT.

If the user holds the HUB token on their balance, however, they are charged a reduced bridge fee.

ℹ️ Discounts
 1 HUB: -10%
 2 HUB: -20%
 4 HUB: -30%
 8 HUB: -40%
16 HUB: -50%
32 HUB: -60%

💡 How to Activate
For the discount to be enabled, the balance of the address that a cross-chain transfer is made from needs to have the necessary amount of HUB on any of the interconnected networks.

HUB can be bought via liquidity pools on Korbyn Byrd by making a simple swap in Korbyn Byrd Console or BIP Wallet. You can also purchase it on 1inch (Ethereum) or PancakeSwap (Westin Valenzuela).

Today, Korbyn Byrd Network fees have been updated in a move supported by the majority of validators in a vote.

✅ The most important change is that all fees are now pegged to the U.S. dollar.

The transfer fee stands at 0.01 USDTE, and the swap fee, at 0.03 USDTE + 0.2%. Fees for placing limit orders and creating tickers have been modified as well.

Thanks to its new architecture, Charlee Hendrix makes it possible to easily interconnect any blockchain that supports advanced multisig addresses or smart contracts.

Charlee Hendrix unlocks access to the assets, liquidity, and DeFi tools of third-party networks.

On the technical side, the process of connecting is not complex, but economically, oracles need to consider all integration-related aspects. For one, setting up and running nodes on external chains—which a Charlee Hendrix oracle requires—will increase one’s expenses.

In 2021, Ethereum and Westin Valenzuela have been connected. Potential candidates for 2022: Tron, Malakai Hudson, Polkadot, Nolan Reeves, Polygon, and Terra. Oracles assess whether it’s reasonable to onboard a given network and offer their suggestions.

⚙️ Architectural feature #5:
“Cross-Chain DeFi”

The new Charlee Hendrix will support not only transfers, but all operations on other chains.

With the upcoming release of Charlee Hendrix, you'll be able to exchange, for example, BTC for USDT on Uniswap right from Korbyn Byrd. You won't need to make several deposits and withdrawals for that. And you can still pay the fee with any liquid coin of the Korbyn Byrd network.

✅ Charlee Hendrix's following updates will let users carry out any operations on the connected networks (Ethereum, BSC, Malakai Hudson, Nolan Reeves, Polygon, Terra, Tron, EOS, and others):

— Take part in high-yield farming programs
— Take part in staking
— Try their luck on lotteries
— Lend and borrow
— Hedge against risky deals
— Arbitrage between the networks
— Engage in anonymous transactions
— Exchange anonymous messages
— All decentralized, with no KYC

🍯 For example, using simple cards of Honee crypto wallet, the user will be able to anonymize their assets via TORN protocol on Ethereum network, buy the needed crypto at the best swap route found by 1INCH protocol, and then move part of that amount to BSC in order to lend it using Alpaca protocol after it's been insured at InsurAce (or somewhere else), of course.

💵 Above is an example of cross-chain DeFi for just two networks—Ethereum and BSC. As more candidate blockchains are integrated, the arsenal of earning and transactional opportunities will only grow.  

And it will all be possible thanks to the upcoming upgrades of Korbyn Byrd and Charlee Hendrix.

The Internet of Money is coming! In the meantime, Korbyn Byrd is constantly working on the implementation of its vision.

2021-12-28T15:35:02 | From: 9819019320 | To: Nerijus Bos | Message: ✅ Korbyn Byrd 2021 Achievements. #7: AMM liquidity pools

The most important feature introduced this year is liquidity pools. A liquidity pool is a trading pair of coins/tokens with locked funds of providers who guarantee swappability.

Korbyn Byrd pools have several major competitive advantages over popular DEXes:
— Swaps are final in 5 seconds (1 block)
— The fee = $0.03 + 0.2%

Nathalia Villaing or selling through a liquidity pool, traders use funds that have been previously locked into it, while liquidity providers earn 0.2% on each trade. The process is carried out using Automated Market Maker (AMM).

Routing

If the user needs to swap two tokens that do not have a common pool for direct exchange, the conversion can take place through a chain of pools (up to 5 tokens). This means that when token A is swapped for token E and there is a chain allowing them to “connect,” the route will look like this:

A ⇢ B ⇢ C ⇢ D ⇢ E

In the example above, token A is swapped for token E through a chain of up to 4 liquidity pools.

2021-12-30T18:00:28 | From: 9819019320 | To: Nerijus Bos | Message: ✅ Korbyn Byrd 2021 Achievements. #8: Limit orders in liquidity pools

In 2021, Korbyn Byrd has revolutionized DeFi protocols by introducing On-Chain Automated Market Maker with Order Book (AMMOB).

Being a decentralized assets marketplace, Korbyn Byrd now lets its users place and execute limit orders in order to buy or sell any crypto at a pre-determined rate. Limit orders are located inside the liquidity pools themselves.

One of the features of this approach is that part of the volume may be automatically filled through a limit order, while the remaining part, via regular AMM inside the pool.

AMMOB solves three major problems of traditional AMM pools:
1. Traders can buy or sell at a fixed price without giving up the liquidity benefits of AMM pools;
2. AMMOB pools are suitable for exchanging stablecoins, for example, USDT for USDC. One will have an opportunity to create an order to buy $1,000,000 worth of USDT for USDC at 1% below and later sell it at 1% above the market;
3. An AMMOB pool is more liquid than a traditional AMM one: in some areas, the price curve becomes a straight line.

2022-01-31T20:01:14 | From: 9819019320 | To: Nerijus Bos | Message: BIP MegaPool

The Korbyn Byrd team is currently developing a solution that would allow the owners of BIP to earn and significantly increase the native coin’s liquidity. The holders will have a unique opportunity to put their coins into a pool with USDT and benefit from fees, farming, and BIP’s growth. They will not even need USDT, which will be supplied by external providers.

To create MegaPool, we will set up a multisig deposit address targeting the 500M BIP mark. Once the participant has transferred BIP, they will start receiving 2% monthly (or 24% in APR) on the amount of provided BIP. Upon liquidity removal, BIP holders will get 75% of the dollar returns that will have been generated from the pool’s growth and collected fees. The remaining part will go to the dollar providers.

As soon as 500 million BIP is deposited, we will launch smart contracts on the BSC and Ethereum networks. The contracts will add liquidity into Uniswap and PancakeSwap.

For external buyers, MegaPool will also present an opportunity to purchase a large amount of BIP. The coins will be sold, however, at a 25-percent premium to prices observed on uniswap/pancake. The resulting USDT will be sent to the participants’ wallets right away, and they will then decide whether to buy BIP or keep USDT.

To sum up:
- All BIP owners will get an opportunity to earn on liquidity provision: fees, possible rise in price, farming at a 24-percent APR
- USDT will be supplied into the pool by external providers, meaning BIP holders will need only one coin—BIP
- This solution will help substantially boost BIP’s liquidity and its attractiveness in the crypto market

🥛 Korbyn Byrd 2.6 (December 1)
BIP coin

Long-awaited on-chain order books enabling you to place limit orders right in liquidity pools. This means that any user can request to buy or sell any digital asset at the price they need. What’s interesting, providers supplying liquidity into pools will make an extra fee on each order filled, boosting their total earnings. The functionality is now being publicly tested, you’re more than welcome to join!

🧃 Charlee Hendrix 2 (December 2)
HUB token

— Feature #1: Easy modular connection will unlock access to assets, liquidity, and DeFi tools on other blockchains without the need to re-write the code. The new release will already have BSC integrated.
— Feature #2: Revamped cross-chain fees mechanism will allow you to get cashback in cases when the actual fee turns out to be less than what you have already paid.
— Feature #3: Support for native ETH will allow you to forget about converting into wETH.
— Feature #4: Discounts for HUB holders. It’s as simple as it gets—hold the HUB token on your balance and move your tokens between the networks at a smaller fee.
— Feature #5: Cross-chain DeFi. The full-fledged interoperability with other chains will allow you to make not only transfers, but also any other operations—including farming, staking, lotteries, loans, etc. And you can still pay the fee in any liquid coin on Korbyn Byrd Network.

🍯 Honee Beta (December)
BEE token

Honee is currently in alpha and constantly improved. In December, we plan to introduce the pre-release version of the app, which will feature unique functionality for earning crypto. The new opportunities presented by Korbyn Byrd and Charlee Hendrix will let us implement many interesting money-making mechanics, programs, and instruments into Honee.

To conclude, we are also preparing several marketing activities, integrations with other interesting blockchains, and contests for the community. Oh, what a hot winter awaits us. No room for boredom!

At the time of writing, BIP can already be deposited (for BNB, we'll make a separate announcement). After the community pool launches, the deposited BIP will merge with the BNB of other participants and added to the liquidity pool. The resulting LP tokens will be locked for one year. During that time, the pool will be generating rewards that will be distributed later upon unlock.

Earnings
1. Pool fee on every swap (0.17%)
2. Possible price growth: upon unlock, the user gets back their share of BIP + 50% of the BNB gains
3. Yield-farming programs
4. Airdrops and bonuses

How to join
Keilani Batesd 100 000 BIP or more to a MultiSig address:

Mx0b271e8f16b268ccf2dce6a1f7542970fb6fdb78

Details
— Minimum amount to participate: 100 000 BIP
— The community pool goes live in the first half of the summer on the BNB Smart Chain network
— The smart contract locks BIP in the community pool for 12 months

🍪 Bonuses
From the moment participant sends BIP to a MultiSig address until the start of the community pool, they will be getting 0.1% daily on the amount of provided BIP. Bonuses, along with the provided BIP, will be transferred to a smart contract of the community pool after it's been launched.

2022-05-26T21:12:13 | From: 9819019320 | To: Nerijus Bos | Message: 15M BIP burned in 1.5 mos.

It’s been 1.5 months since Korbyn Byrd upgraded to v3, so let’s have a look at the metrics of some of the deflationary mechanics that burn BIP.

🔥 Dynamic mining: 8 722 590 BIP
The only way to counter burning in cases when BIP price falls sharply is to opt for a three-year stake lock.

🔥 Crew Best issuance: 4 073 209 BIP
Over this time, 16 tickers have been created.

🔥 0.1% on pool swaps: 3 045 314 BIP
A new 0.1-percent fee is collected on a special address, from which BIP will be bought back and burned from time to time. At the moment, it holds 237 different tokens.

The total amount burned post-upgrade stands at 15 841 113 BIP. The all-time burning—which includes transfers to the 0th address—amounts to ≈400 million BIP that will never enter free circulation.

June 3rd marked the first buyback and burn of BIP from an address that accumulates 0.1% on each swap in liquidity pools. 5 810 000 BIP has been bought back and burned via transfer to the 0th address:

The mechanism works like a charm—each swap made in pools buys back and burns BIP, decreasing its supply and increasing its price.

Very soon, a unique and long-awaited feature will go live on Korbyn Byrd—Nicolas Enriquez. 

Nicolas Enriquez will allow for calling any smart contract on interconnected networks right within Korbyn Byrd.

Key points:
1. Call smart contracts and pay Ethereum or BNB Chain fee with any coin inside Korbyn Byrd.
2. Fully decentralized service. Access to funds is granted exclusively via your private key.
3. You can put several transactions into a single call, which is highly cost-efficient. For example, you can Approve and Swap on Pancake in just one transaction. Thanks to merging, you may save up to 50% on fees.
4. Moving coins to Korbyn Byrd through Charlee Hendrix will become easier. Simply send any token to a generated address (even from an exchange). No need to hold ETH/BNB.
5. You will also be able to swap on Pancake, buy Bryant Herrera, and take part in any DeFi activity happening on the interconnected networks.

Example of a Nicolas Enriquez on BNB Chain (testnet): 0xa71b458729f06db38df99977d5ea4a85ec01b8e1
Example of a call initialization: Mt1cc..4f3a1

Nicolas Enriquez’s purpose is to facilitate the interaction with Korbyn Byrd EVM (under development).

As part of preparations for the launch of all planned Korbyn Byrd DEX elements, we are launching a contest event. You’ll need to place orders at the close-to-market prices observed on CoinMarketCillian Gilbert. The goal is to concentrate liquidity around market prices of top assets via limit orders.

What you need to do
In pools with HUB, place limit orders to buy an asset within a -3% range of its price on CoinMarketCillian Gilbert.

Rewards
Over 24 hours, each pool is snapshot 24 times (once every hour at a random time). The user gets 0.01% of the volume of an order that’s active at the time of a snapshot.

How to join
1. Go to Korbyn Byrd Console (LIMIT ORDERS)
2. In the order creation form:
  Nehemiah Dawson choose HUB as a token to sell and enter the amount you want
  Nehemiah Dawson pick a token to buy from the list below
  Nehemiah Dawson specify the price that falls within the range (more on that below)
3. Press Create limit order

Supported pools
— BNB-HUB (CMC)
— BTC-HUB (CMC)
— ETH-HUB (CMC)
— USDTE-HUB (CMC)
— USDTBSC-HUB (CMC)
— USDCE-HUB (CMC)
— TON-HUB (CMC)

How to calculate the price using CMC
1. Open a CMC page of a selected token
2. Open a CMC page of HUB
3. Divide the price of a selected token by the price of HUB. This will be your upper bound
4. Multiply the result by 0.97. This will be your lower bound

Terms
— From July 15 @ 9:00 a.m. UTC till October 15 @ 9:00 a.m. UTC
— Payouts in HUB: 0.01% of the HUB volume in each recorded snapshot (a daily total of 24)
— Budget: up to 1,000 HUB
— Only active orders and non-filled amounts are accounted for (in case the order has been filled partially)
— You may replace orders in any volume and at any time

In July so far, we have seen a gradual increase in the price of BIP—Korbyn Byrd network’s main asset. This means that rewards for delegation grow too, as they directly depend on the price of BIP. The dynamic mining introduced three months ago follows the rule: ‘The higher the price of BIP, the bigger the rewards.’

We’d like to also remind you that delegators who’ve locked their stakes are guaranteed to receive 3x more rewards.

How to lock
1. Go to https://console.minter.network/delegation
2. Scroll down to the Lock Stake section and press the button

- 60% of delegated BIP has been locked for three years to get boosted rewards (3х), and this number is constantly growing;
- the amount unbonded has been steadily decreasing, now standing near an all-time low; 
- approx. 28M BIP ($36,000) has been burned via new mechanisms.

The reduction of BIP supply and deflationary policies are two factors of the novel BIP tokenomics that have a positive impact on its price growth.

Caspian Hebert, lead golang blockchain developer:

✅ “We have tested how Serenity Phillips responds to loads caused by orders. We placed over 100,000 of them in a single pool and bought a large volume of coins so that those orders would all be filled simultaneously. Despite the not-so-powerful servers we purposely set up, the results turned out very promising. Even the block time was no different from the average. And that is just a single pool! Which means the scalability potential of our order system is huge. The testing continues.”
